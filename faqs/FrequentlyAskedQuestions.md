자주 묻는 질문들
============

This section provides answers to a number of common questions that are asked about the game.  e entries are presented in a question and answer format, with the newest questions at the end of the list.

Can I investigate a location with no clues on it? If I do, what happens?
Yes. You can investigate a location even if there are no clues on it. However, you won’t be able to discover any clues there, because there are no clues on the location to discover.

Investigating a location with no clues might still be useful to trigger card abilities such as Burglary (Core 45) or Scavenging (Core 73).
Are clues on Cover Up (Core 7) considered to be “at my location” for the purposes of Roland’s   ability?
No. Generally speaking, cards (such as investigators, assets under your control, enemies in your threat area, etc) are “at” a location. Clues are only “at” a location if they are physically on that location (“Clues,” Rules Reference, page 7).

Is there any di erence between “at a location” and “in a location?”
No. Both terms have the same meaning and are used interchangeably.

If I play an event with a Fight ability, like Backstab (Core 51), does it provoke a acks of opportunity?
No. Abilities with a bold action designator (like Fight, Evade or Investigate) count as an action of that type. In this case, since Backstab counts as a Fight action, no a acks of opportunity are made, because Fight actions do not provoke a acks of opportunity.  e same goes for Fight abilities on assets, like .45 Automatic (Core 16).

If I use an   ability or play an event with a bold action type (like Fight, Evade, or Investigate), do I need to spend one action to use the ability and another action to initiate the action listed? Or just one action?
Paying the cost of the ability is enough to initiate the action designated.  ere is no need to spend an additional action.

Can I trigger the   abilities on two copies of .45 Automatic (Core 16) for +2   and +2 damage?
No. Each   ability is a separate action that must be resolved in full before you have the opportunity to take another action.

Can I trigger the ability   on cards like Physical Training (Core 17) more than once per skill test?
Yes. Unless the ability has a printed limitation on it, you may use it as o en as you like, provided you are able to pay the ability’s cost each time.

If there are clues or cards at an unrevealed location, and then that location is revealed, what happens to those clues/cards?
Any clues or cards at an unrevealed location remain where they are when the location is revealed.  is includes clues physically placed on the location, enemies or assets at that location, and cards a ached to that location. Clues that are placed on the newly revealed location from its clue value are simply added to the clues that were already on that location when it was revealed.

If a card e ect says to heal damage or horror but does not indicate  om where, can I use it to heal assets or investigators other than myself?
No. “Heal X damage/horror” is shorthand for “Heal X damage/horror from your investigator.” If a card simply reads “Heal X horror” or “Heal
X damage,” you can only use it to heal horror or damage from your investigator. Cards that allow you to heal other investigators or assets will specify that.

Who gets the e ects/bene ts of a skill card commi ed to another investigator’s skill test? If I commit Overpower (Core 91) to another investigator’s skill test, do I get to draw 1 card, or does the investigator performing the skill test get to draw 1 card?
Generally speaking, the player who commi ed the skill card gets the e ects of any ability on that skill card. In your example, you would draw the 1 card, not the investigator performing the skill test. However, if a skill card changes or adds to the results of the skill test itself, the investigator performing the test receives the bene t of that ability. For example, if you commi ed Deduction (Core 39) to another investigator’s skill test, that investigator would be discovering the additional clue, not you, because you are altering the e ects of his or her skill test.

When I use the ability on Stray Cat (Core 76), can I choose any enemy at my location, even if they are engaged with other investigators?
Yes. When you perform a standard evade action, you may only a empt to evade enemies engaged with you. However, card e ects (such as Stray Cat or Cunning Distraction (Core 78) may alter or supplant this limitation.

When I a ack using Shrivelling (Core 60) and reveal a  ,  ,  ,  , or   symbol, when do I take 1 horror?
You would take 1 horror immediately as you reveal the symbol, during “ST.3 Reveal chaos token” (“Skill Test Timing,” Rules Reference, page 26). If you had any reactions to taking that horror (such as Agnes Baker’s ability), you would trigger it then, before resolving the rest of the a ack.

If I automatically fail a test ( om revealing a   symbol, for example), I treat my skill value as if it were 0. If the di culty of the test is 0, does that mean I succeed?
No. No ma er what, if you automatically fail a test, you have failed the test, regardless of how your skill value and the di culty compare.

How does “searching the collection” for a random basic weakness work? Do I use the same pool of weaknesses I used during deck construction? Or do I search through all of my weaknesses?
Anytime players are instructed to search for a random basic weakness—be it during deck construction, during a scenario’s setup or resolution, or during a scenario itself—players should use the same pool of weaknesses, which is constructed using all of the basic weaknesses from only 1 copy of each product they own. If each investigator has their own collection of cards, they should each use their own pool of weaknesses constructed in the same manner, so as to avoid players’ cards ge ing mixed together accidentally.
For example: Damon and Kelsy have each constructed decks using Damon’s collection, which consists of 2 copies of the Core Set. During deck construction, they each included 1 random basic weakness from a pool of weaknesses consisting of only the 10 weaknesses in a single copy of the Core Set.  is leaves a pool of 8 weaknesses remaining. If they are later instructed to each search the collection for a random basic weakness, these weaknesses would be taken from that remaining pool of 8 weaknesses.

I have commi ed Double or Nothing (TDL 26) and Perception (Core 90) to a skill test during an investigation, and I also have Dr. Milan Christopher (Core 33) in play. If I succeed, which e ects are resolved twice?
e e ects of a successful skill test are applied during step 7, and Double or Nothing causes each of these a ects to be resolved twice. Dr. Milan Christopher’s ability is a reaction to succeeding at a skill test, and therefore is triggered and resolved during step 6, a er success is determined. During step 7, the game result of the investigation (discovering 1 clue), and the “if this test is successful” result of Perception are both resolved twice due to Double or Nothing’s e ect.
