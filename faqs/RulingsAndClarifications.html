<p>This section contains additions and clari cations to the core game rules. Each entry is presented with a unique section number so it can be easily identi ed when making rulings, answering questions, or otherwise referring to the entry.
It should be used in conjunction with the Rules Reference to establish the rules of play. If the text of this document directly contradicts the text of the Rules Reference, the text of this document takes precedence.</p>
<h1 id="game-play">Game play</h1>
<h2 id="11-a-acks-of-opportunity">(1.1) A acks of Opportunity</h2>
<p>A acks of Opportunity are only triggered when 1 or more of an investigator&#x2019;s actions are being spent or used to trigger an ability or action.   abilities with a bold action designator do not provoke a acks of opportunity.</p>
<h2 id="12-triggered-abilities">(1.2) Triggered Abilities</h2>
<p>An investigator is permi ed to use triggered abilities ( ,  , and   abilities) from the following sources:
= A card in play and under his or her control.  is includes his or her investigator card.
= A scenario card that is in play and at the same location as the investigator.  is includes the location itself, encounter cards placed at that location, and all encounter cards in the threat area of any investigator at that location.
=  e current act or current agenda card.
= Any card that explicitly allows the investigator to activate its ability.</p>
<h2 id="13-reaction---opportunities">(1.3) Reaction ( ) Opportunities</h2>
<p>When a triggering condition resolves, investigators are granted the opportunity to resolve   abilities in response to that triggering condition. It is only a er all investigators have passed their reaction opportunity that the game moves forward.
Using a   ability in response to a triggering condition does not prevent other   abilities from being used in response to that same triggering condition.
For example: Roland has just defeated an enemy and wishes to trigger his   ability: &#x201C;A er you defeat an enemy: Discover 1 clue at your location.&#x201D;
He discovers 1 clue at his location. He may then play Evidence! (Core 22) in response to defeating that same enemy. As both cards have the same triggering condition (&#x201C;A er you defeat an enemy&#x201D;), triggering one of these reactions does not prevent Roland  om triggering the other.</p>
<h2 id="14-nested-sequences">(1.4) Nested Sequences</h2>
<p>Each time a triggering condition occurs, the following sequence is followed: (1) execute &#x201C;when...&#x201D; e ects that interrupt that triggering condition,
(2) resolve the triggering condition, and then, (3) execute &#x201C;a er...&#x201D; e ects in response to that triggering condition.
Within this sequence, if the use of a   or Forced ability leads to a new triggering condition, the game pauses and starts a new sequence: (1) execute &#x201C;when...&#x201D; e ects that interrupt the new triggering condition, (2) resolve the new triggering condition, and then, (3) execute &#x201C;a er...&#x201D; e ects in response to the new triggering condition.  is is called a nested sequence. Once this nested sequence is completed, the game returns to where it le  o , continuing with the original triggering condition&#x2019;s sequence.
It is possible that a nested sequence generates further triggering conditions (and hence more nested sequences).  ere is no limit to the number of nested sequences that may occur, but each nested sequence must complete before returning to the sequence that spawned it. In e ect, these sequences are resolved in a Last In, First Out (LIFO) manner.
For example: Roland and Agnes are embroiled in a  erce ba le. Roland has a Guard Dog in his play area, and is engaged with a Goat Spawn with 2 damage on it. Agnes is engaged with a Ghoul Minion. Roland wishes to play a .45 Automatic, which provokes an a ack of opportunity  om the Goat Spawn, dealing 1 damage to Roland. Roland assigns this damage to his Guard Dog, which has a   ability: &#x201C;When an enemy a ack deals damage to Guard Dog: Deal 1 damage to the a acking enemy.&#x201D; Before resolving the playing of Roland&#x2019;s .45 Automatic, Guard Dog&#x2019;s ability resolves, and 1 damage is dealt to the Goat Spawn, which would defeat it. Goat Spawn has the following Forced ability: &#x201C;When Goat Spawn is defeated: Each investigator at this location takes 1 horror.&#x201D; Before resolving the damage dealt to the Guard Dog, 1 horror is dealt to each investigator at the location, including Agnes, who has a   ability: &#x201C;A er
1 or more horror is placed on Agnes Baker: Deal 1 damage to an enemy at your location.&#x201D; Before resolving the Goat Spawn&#x2019;s defeat, Agnes deals 1 damage to the Ghoul Minion engaged with her. Now that there are no further   or Forced abilities to trigger, the players return to the previous triggering condition and resolve the Goat Spawn&#x2019;s defeat, and resolve any &#x201C;A er...&#x201D; e ects that might occur when it is defeated.  en, the players resolve the damage dealt to the Guard Dog, and resolve any &#x201C;A er...&#x201D; e ects that might occur  om that damage. Finally, the players return to the original triggering condition, and Roland is able to put his .45 Automatic into play.</p>
<h2 id="15-choices-and-the-grim-rule">(1.5) Choices, and the Grim Rule</h2>
<p>When investigators are forced to make a choice and there are multiple valid options, the lead investigator decides between those options.  e Grim Rule does not play a part in these choices.
For example: Locked Door reads &#x201C;A ach to the location with the most clues, and without a Locked Door a ached.&#x201D; If there are 3 locations that are tied for the most clues, and none of them already have a Locked Door a ached, the lead investigator decides between those 3 locations. Players are not forced to decide which of those 3 options would be the objectively worst option.
The Grim Rule only comes into e ect if players are unable to  nd the answer to a rules or timing con ict, and are thus unable to continue playing the game. It is designed to keep the game moving when looking up the correct answer would be too time-consuming or inconvenient for the players.  e Grim Rule is not an exhaustive answer to rules/timing con icts.</p>
<h2 id="16-additional-costs">(1.6) Additional Costs</h2>
<p>Some cards add additional costs that must be paid in order to perform certain e ects or actions, in the form of &#x201C;As an additional cost to (speci ed e ect/action) you must (additional cost)&#x201D; or &#x201C;You must (additional cost) to (speci ed e ect/action).&#x201D;
Additional costs are costs that can be paid outside the normal timing point of paying costs (for instance, during the resolution of an e ect). If an e ect that requires an additional cost would resolve, the additional cost must be paid at that time. If the additional cost cannot be paid, that aspect of the e ect fails to resolve.
Additional costs do not have to be paid when a Forced e ect or mandatory instruction (such as in the Campaign Guide, or on the back of an Act or Agenda card) requires an investigator to resolve an e ect.
For example: &#x201C;Ashcan&#x201D; Pete is at the Miskatonic Quad and activates Duke&#x2019;s second ability, which reads: &#x201C;  Exhaust Duke: Investigate. You investigate with a base skill of 4. You may move to a connecting location immediately before investigating with this e ect.&#x201D; Pete pays the cost to activate this ability, which
is spending one action and exhausting Duke.  en Pete resolves the ability,
 rst moving to the Orne Library, followed by investigating.  e Orne Library, however, reads: &#x201C;You must spend 1 additional action to investigate the Orne Library.&#x201D;  is adds an additional cost that must be paid in order to investigate the Orne Library.  is additional cost is paid when the investigate action would resolve, outside the normal timing point for paying costs. If Pete cannot spend the additional action, that aspect of Duke&#x2019;s e ect fails to resolve.</p>
<h2 id="17-skill-test-results-and-advanced-timing">(1.7) Skill Test Results and Advanced Timing</h2>
<p>During Step 7 of Skill Test Timing (&#x201C;Apply skill test results&#x201D;), all of the e ects of the successful skill test are determined and resolved, one at a time.  is includes the e ects of the test itself (such as the clue discovered while investigating, or the damage dealt during an a ack), as well as any &#x201C;If this test is successful...&#x201D; e ects from card abilities or skill cards commi ed to the test.
  or Forced abilities with a triggering condition dependent upon the
skill test being successful or unsuccessful (such as &#x201C;A er you successfully investigate,&#x201D; or &#x201C;A er you fail a skill test by 2 or more&#x201D;) do not trigger at this time.  ese abilities are triggered during Step 6, &#x201C;Determine success/failure of skill test.&#x201D;</p>
<h1 id="card-ability-interpretation">Card Ability Interpretation</h1>
<h2 id="21-youyour-expanded">(2.1) &#x201C;You/Your,&#x201D; expanded</h2>
<p> e following guidelines are used to interpret which investigator is referenced by the words &#x201C;you&#x201D; and &#x201C;your.&#x201D;
= A Revelation ability that references &#x201C;you/your&#x201D; refers to the investigator who drew the card and is resolving the ability.
= When resolving a triggered ability ( ,  , or   ability), &#x201C;you/ your&#x201D; refers to the investigator triggering the ability.
= If an ability contains a clause identifying whom it is targeting, &#x201C;you/ your&#x201D; in that ability refers to those investigators. For example, Stubborn Detective (Core 103) reads: &#x201C;While Stubborn Detective is at your location...&#x201D; this clause identi es &#x201C;you&#x201D; as any investigator at his location. Young Deep One reads: &#x201C;A er Young Deep One engages you...&#x201D; this clause identi es &#x201C;you&#x201D; as any investigator who engages Young Deep One.
= Any other instance of &#x201C;you/your&#x201D; that does not fall into the above categories refers to the investigator who controls the card, the investigator who has the card in his/her threat area, or who is currently interacting with the card.
A card may have multiple di erent abilities in which &#x201C;you/your&#x201D; may be interpreted di erently. &#x201C;You/your&#x201D; may refer to a di erent investigator in each of these abilities.
For example: Dreams of R&#x2019;lyeh reads:
&#x201C;Revelation - Put Dreams of R&#x2019;lyeh into play in your threat area. You get &#x2013;1   and &#x2013;1 sanity.
 : Test   (3). If you succeed, Discard Dreams of R&#x2019;lyeh.&#x201D;
 ese three abilities reference &#x201C;you/your&#x201D; in di erent ways. For the Revelation ability, &#x201C;your&#x201D; refers to the investigator who drew Dreams of R&#x2019;lyeh and is resolving its Revelation. For its constant ability, &#x201C;you&#x201D; refers to the investigator who has Dreams of R&#x2019;lyeh in his or her threat area. For its   ability, &#x201C;you&#x201D; refers to the investigator who is performing the   ability.</p>
<h2 id="22-timing-of-at-or-if-abilities">(2.2) Timing of &#x201C;At...&#x201D; or &#x201C;If...&#x201D; abilities</h2>
<p>Some abilities have triggering conditions that use the words &#x201C;at&#x201D; or &#x201C;if&#x201D; instead of specifying &#x201C;when&#x201D; or &#x201C;a er,&#x201D; such as &#x201C;at the end of the round,&#x201D; or &#x201C;if the Ghoul Priest is defeated.&#x201D;  ese e ects trigger in between any &#x201C;when...&#x201D; abilities and any &#x201C;a er...&#x201D; abilities with the same triggering condition.</p>
