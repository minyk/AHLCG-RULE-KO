정의와 용어들
==========

이 장에서는 게임에서의 정확한 기능을 하도록 중요한 용어들의 정의를 제공합니다. 용어들은 알파벳 순으로 정렬되어 있습니다.

# “Record in your Campaign Log...”
플레이어들이 중요한 문구를 캠페인 로그에 기록하도록 지시받으면, 다른 지시가 없는 한 이 문장을 "캠페인 노트"에 기록해야 합니다. 캠페인을 진행하는 동안 차후에 캠페인 로그에서 이 문장을 확인하도록 지시받을 수 있기 때문에 지정된 문장을 변경없이 기록해야 합니다.

For example: If the players are instructed to record in the Campaign Log that “the investigators were four hours late,” this shouldn’t be rewri en as “the investigators were pre y late,” because the exact number of hours might be important in a later scenario.

# “Remember that...”
Sometimes a scenario card will instruct the investigators to “remember”
a key phrase, o en based on an action they have taken or a decision they have made within that scenario.  is phrase may come up later during that scenario, and may trigger additional or di erent e ects.  ere is no need to record this phrase in the Campaign Log, because it will only ever ma er during that scenario, or during that scenario’s resolution.  e players do not need to “remember” any such instruction beyond the end of the scenario in which it appears.

# Signature Cards
An investigator’s “signature cards” are the cards that are only available to that investigator, and cannot be included in another investigator’s deck.  is includes player cards with the text “(Investigator Name) deck only,” as well as non-basic weaknesses that are listed under “Deckbuilding Requirements” and therefore can only be included in that investigator’s deck.
Signature cards are governed by the following additional rules:
* The number of each signature card listed under an investigator’s “Deckbuilding Requirements” is the exact number of copies of that card that is to be included in that investigator’s deck. If no number is speci ed, that number is 1.
For example: Under “Deckbuilding Requirements” for Roland Banks, the following cards are listed: “Roland’s .38 Special, Cover Up, 1 random basic weakness.” Roland Banks must include exactly 1 copy of his signature cards—Roland’s .38 Special and Cover Up. He is not permi ed to include more than 1 copy of either of these cards.
* An investigator’s signature cards cannot be traded or given to other investigators.
For example: Roland has the Roland’s .38 Special card in play. He has the card “Teamwork” which can allow investigators at the same location to trade or give assets among one another. However, because Roland’s .38 Special is one of Roland’s signature cards, he cannot give it to another investigator.
