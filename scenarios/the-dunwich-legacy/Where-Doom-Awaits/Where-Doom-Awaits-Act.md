## Act 1: The Path to the Hill

### A: The Path to the Hill

A vibrant arcane energy fills the air with a bone-rattling chill. The energy swirls along the crushed trail before you, and seeps down several other paths before disappearing.

### B: A Sacrifice Made

During your search through the wooded paths around the base of Sentinel Hill, you come across a startling sight. A herd of sheep lays dead upon on the ground in a secluded clearing, their bloodied carcasses placed in a strange but careful pattern. Holding your nose against the stench of death, you step over mangled sheep on your way to the center of the odd formation.

In the center of the sheep lies the corpse of a man. A clear jewel has been firmly pressed into his forehead, caving in the front of his skull. His eyes are wide, his face contorted in a vision of fear, as if beseeching you for mercy. Though you know better, you check for a pulse. As you touch the man’s skin, the jewel in his forehead dissolves, and the woods around you seem to clear.

* The arcane presence masking the path further up the hill has faded. Reveal Ascending Path.
* Remove all clues from each location in play.

## Act 2: Ascending the Hill (v. I)

### A: Ascending the Hill

As you ascend the hill, the environment around you grows increasingly strange and otherworldly. The arcane energy feels even stronger here, crackling in the air and crawling on your skin.

### B: Trip the Pattern

Approaching the peak of Sentinel Hill, you are confronted by several citizens of Dunwich. The man in the center of their circle chants in Latin while the others bow their heads in reverence. “Seth Bishop?” you ask presumptively. The man in the center raises his gaze in response, confirming your suspicions. You plead with the man to stop this madness, but he doesn’t respond. You draw forth the silver constellation pendant you’d found on Silas’s body and present it to Seth. “This is all we found of your brother,” you shout over the howling wind. “Is this the fate you want for yourself? For all of us?” You throw the pendant onto the ground. Staggered by the sight of it, he stumbles backwards and trips over his incantation, eyes widened. As he falls, the altar behind him splits open, and a torrent of energy pours from the stone, swirling into an open gate that swallows the man whole. You barely manage to dig your heels in and grab hold of a nearby rock in time to resist the pull of the gate.

* Remove the set-aside Seth Bishop enemy from the game.

## Act 2: Ascending the Hill (v. II)

### A: Ascending the Hill

As you ascend the hill, the environment around you grows increasingly strange and otherworldly. The arcane energy feels even stronger here, crackling in the air and crawling on your skin.

### B: Turn the Key

Approaching the peak of Sentinel Hill, you are confronted by several citizens of Dunwich. The man in the center of their circle lets out a crazed laugh. You recognize the man—Seth Bishop—from the description given to you by the townsfolk earlier. Behind him, several other men and women bow their heads in reverence, chanting in Latin. “We’ve done it!” he cackles. “We’ve accomplished what Old Whateley and ‘is git couldn’t!” You watch in revulsion as his eyes glaze over and twitch, as though he were reading something invisible. “I can see now... I can finally see!” He raises his hands to the sky and the headstone of the altar behind him splits open. A torrent of energy pours out of the stone, coalescing into the form of an open gate. Seth holds onto the stone in front of him to prevent himself from being sucked into the gate, but several of the others are startled and pulled through it. You barely manage to dig your heels in and grab hold of a nearby rock in time to resist the pull of the gate. Seth rises to his feet, wearing an expression of pride.

* Put the set-aside Seth Bishop enemy into play at Sentinel Peak.

## Act 2: Ascending the Hill (v. III)

### A: Ascending the Hill (v. III)

As you ascend the hill, the environment around you grows increasingly strange and otherworldly. The arcane energy feels even stronger here, crackling in the air and crawling on your skin.

### B: Will the Change

Approaching the peak of Sentinel Hill, you are confronted by several citizens of Dunwich. The man in the center of their circle is desperately trying to complete a Latin incantation. “It’s not working, Seth!” one of the other men cries out. “What’re we gonna do?” The man in the center stops his chant and pulls out a cobbler’s knife. “The father demands a blood sacrifice,” he declares, and his face twists into a crazed expression. Before you can react, he slits his left wrist with the knife, dropping to his knees in agony. The headstone of the altar behind him splits open. A torrent of energy pours out of the stone, coalescing into the form of an open gate. Seth holds onto the stone in front of him to prevent himself from being sucked into the gate, but several of the others are startled and pulled through it. You barely manage to dig your heels in and grab hold of a nearby rock in time to resist the pull of the gate. Seth rises, wounded but alive. An expression of pride spreads across his pained face.

* Put the set-aside Seth Bishop enemy into play at Sentinel Peak, with 1[per investigator] damage on him.

## Act 3: The Gate Opens

### A: The Gate Opens

From the ruins of the headstone on the altar at the hill’s peak, a gateway of churning vibrant energy has appeared. A force like a hurricane erupts from the gate, bending trees and pulling debris into it. The howling of the gale drowns out all other sound. Somehow, you must find a way to close the gate.

### B: Peer into the Abyss

You don’t know how to close the swirling gate before you, and with each passing moment, the force from within it grows in strength. You fear that whatever entity the sorcerers have summoned from beyond approaches. With no time to spare, you turn to the open tome on the stone altar, desperate for answers.
