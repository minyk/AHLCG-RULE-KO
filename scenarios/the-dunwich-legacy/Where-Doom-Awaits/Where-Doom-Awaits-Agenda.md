## Agenda 1: Calling Forth the Old Ones

### A: Calling Forth the Old Ones

As you approach Sentinel Hill, you hear ancient Latin rites bellowed across the night. The time for action has come. If you cannot stop the sorcerers in Dunwich, who knows what terrors they might unleash upon the world?

### B: The World is Altered

As you explore the paths surrounding Sentinel Hill, the chanting at the hilltop rises to a crescendo and takes an otherworldly quality, reverberating through the trees as if carried by unseen currents.

The world begins to change. The grass and trees dissolve like sugar in a cup of tea. A vast endless sky slices through the reality you see before you, and you feel drawn to it, terrified and awestruck. The arcane power becomes distorted and seeps around you, creating strange alterations in the land.

## Agenda 2: Beckoning for Power

### A: Beckoning for Power

The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones shall be. Not in the spaces we know, but between them, They walk serene and primal, undimensioned and to us unseen. Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through again. He knows where They have trod earth’s fields, and where They still tread them, and why no one can behold Them

### B: The Reward for Servitude

The chanting reaches its climax, and at the summit of Sentinel Hill, a tear opens across the fabric of the sky, parting the clouds and slicing through the very air itself.

You watch as an indescribable entity—spheres, eyes, mouths, ooze­—pours out of the rift. The sorcerers call its name as its form seeps into the sky, spreading forth above the earth. “Iä! Iä! Yog‑Sothoth! Iä! Iä! Yog-Sothoth!”

Before their jubilant chant can continue, they are smothered by the growing mass, and are heard no more.

To your horror, the expansion of the mass does not cease.
