## Agenda 1: All is One

### A: All is One

Pathways of sound and color extend for an eternity in all directions, dotted with impossible architecture, and overgrown with alien wildlife. The lines between objects are jagged and shifting, and your skin feels as if it were inside out.

### B: Familiar Echoes

* Shuffle the encounter discard pile into the encounter deck. Then, discard cards from the top until a location is discarded. The lead investigator resolvse that location’s ‘revelation’ effect.

* Check Campaign Log. If the investigators failed to save the students, read the following:
A huge canine creature, alien to your eyes and yet familiar, appears before you. The creature rushes forward, and you prepare to fend it off, but to your surprise it runs through you, towards a building that wasn’t behind you moments before: Derby Hall from the Miskatonic University. The creature bursts through the building’s front door and you hear screams of panic from inside, followed by the crunch of snapping bones and cries of pain.

* Each investigator takes 1 horror, regardless of their location.

## Agenda 2: Past, Present and Future

### A: Past, Present and Future

As you cross this realm, you catch occasional glimpses of reality – scenes from old memories, more recent visions from the past few days, and sometimes even events that you do not remember ever happening...

### B: The Price of Failure

* Shuffle the encounter discard pile into the encounter deck. Then, discard cards from the top until a location is discarded. The lead investigator resolvse that location’s ‘revelation’ effect.

* Check Campaign Log. If at least one name is recorded under “Sacrificed to Yog-Sothoth,” read the following:
You hear a familiar voice calling out to you, and you enter an impossibly shaped building of cracked stone. “No... don’t!” the voice cries. You rush toward the voice, down a set of steep, narrow stairs. Upon reaching the bottom, you find yourself in the hidden chamber from Dunwich. Bound by shackles, you see those you failed to save, bloodied and maimed. The creature with a man’s face feeds from a corpse on the ground. The head of the corpse turns to face you, and a sharp pain stabs your heart.

* Each investigator tests [Willpower] (X), where X is the number of names recorded under “Sacrificed to Yog-Sothoth.” For each point an investigator fails by, that investigator takes 1 damage.

## Agenda 3: Breaking Through

### A: Breaking Through

Throughout this warped dimension, no matter where you travel, there is a haunting shape in the distance. At first, it appears as a disc, like a black moon with many wriggling arms. But as time passes, you can tell it is growing larger and larger...

### B: The Key and the Gate

* Spawn the set-aside Yog-Sothoth enemy at The Edge of the Universe. If The Edge of the Universe is not in play, spawn it in Another Dimension, instead. Advance to agenda 4a.

## Agenda 4: The End of All Things

### A: The End of All Things

The shape in the distance smashes through the barriers of this dimension, its many arms reaching to envelop everything you see. Its body is like an ooze, covered in eyes and mouths. You feel insignificant, like a bug, next to the creature’s terrifying grandeur.

### B: Yog-Sothoth Attacks!

Seeking the rift from which you entered this dimension, the extradimensional horror lashes out, crushing entire realms within its grasp.

* In player order, Yog-Sothoth attacks each investigator in play, regardless of Yog-Sothoth’s current location. Then, flip this agenda back to its “a” side.
