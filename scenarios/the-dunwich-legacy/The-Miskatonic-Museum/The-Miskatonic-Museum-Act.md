# The Miskatonic Museum

## Act 1: Finding A Way Inside

### A: Finding A Way Inside
Unfortunately, the entrance to the Museum is kept locked at this late hour. A security guard is visible through the building’s front windows, oblivious to his surroundings. Perhaps you can find a way to get his attention and convince him to let you in.

### B: Gaining Entrance
If you spent clues to advance:
You find the window nearest to the guard and tap it loud enough to get his attention. He gives a startled jump, then shifts open the window. “What do you want?” he asks timidly. You explain the situation to him and tell him he is in grave danger. He warily opens the front door to the Museum, shaking his head. “I wasn’t even supposed to be here today...”
Choose an investigator to take control of the set-aside Adam Lynch asset. Reveal the Museum Halls. Advance to
Act 2a – “Night at the Museum.”

If you successfully performed the [Action] ability on the Museum Halls to advance:
With great strength, you break down the door to the Museum, making considerable noise as you do. The security guard sees you enter, cries out in fear, and rushes toward the back of the museum.
The door leading into the Museum Halls is no longer locked. Reveal the Museum Halls. Advance to Act 2a – “Breaking and Entering.”

## Act 2: Breaking and Entering

### A: Breaking and Entering
The Necronomicon is being kept in a Restricted Hall somewhere in the museum.

### B: The Guard's Fate
When you enter the Restricted Hall, you find the curator of the museum clutching an ornate statue as if it were a club, his suit stained with blood, a panicked expression on his face. The security guard you saw earlier lies in a pool of blood nearby, his intestines strewn about in a grotesque display. Your stomach turns and you resist the urge to vomit. “I tried to stop it, but...” the curator says quietly, his voice quivering. Whatever did this, it’s still nearby...

## Act 2: Night at the Museum

### A: Night at the Museum
The Necronomicon is being kept in a Restricted Hall somewhere in the museum. Adam barely knows his way around, and gives a startled jump at every creak of the old building. “I just started here last week,” he explains. “What sort of trouble did you say was going on?” You haven’t the heart to give him the full story.

### B: The Curator's Fate
When you enter the restricted hall, you find the curator of the museum lying in a pool of blood, his intestines strewn about in a grotesque display. Your stomach turns over and you resist the urge to vomit. Whatever did this, it’s still nearby...

## Act 3: Searching for the Tome

### A: Searching for the Tome
Somewhere in this area is Olaus Wormius’s Latin translation of the Necronomicon. You must find it and escape while you can!

### B: The Necronomicon
At last, you find the locked case containing the Necronomicon.
The tome, over eight hundred pages in length, is filled with all manner of macabre imagery, formulae, spells, prophecies and descriptions of creatures from beyond the threshold of space.
Without a doubt, it is a dangerous book... But its secrets could be very useful.
