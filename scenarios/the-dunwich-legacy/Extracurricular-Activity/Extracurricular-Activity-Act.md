# Extracurricular Activity

## Act 1: After Hours

### A: After Hours
Professor Rice was last seen several hours ago by one of Armitage’s students, in the Humanities building.

### B: The Head Janitor
You were unable to find Professor Rice, but one of the students you spoke with mentioned a strange man entering Rice’s office. Unfortunately, the door leading to the faculty offices is locked at this late hour. The student says that the head janitor, “Jazz”, might be able to let you in, if you can find him.

## Act 2: Rice’s Whereabouts

### A: Rice’s Whereabouts
Concerned for Professor Rice’s safety, you seek out the head janitor, who can let you into the locked sections of the campus.

### B: The Experiment is Loose!
You convince “Jazz” that something strange is going on, and that Professor Rice may be in danger. He doesn’t trust you enough to hand you his keys, but agrees to come with you.
All of a sudden, you hear a crash coming from the Science building, and a student rushes toward you. “Help!” he cries. “There’s some kind of animal loose in the chem labs! I only barely caught a glimpse of it, but...” He shudders. “I think it’s heading to the dorms! You’ve got to do something!”

## Act 3: Campus Safety

### A: Campus Safety
You have only moments to react. You could warn the students in the dormitories and escort them to safety, or continue your task of searching the faculty offices for Professor Rice. Or, perhaps you could try to slay the beast that threatens the campus.

### B: The Beast's Death
The monstrous creature lets out a terrible shriek as it succumbs to its wounds and collapses onto the ground. A foul odor emanates from the corpse as its flesh begins to bubble and froth. Your relief turns to disgust as the body begins to shrink and disintegrate. Minutes later, the body has almost entirely evaporated into a sticky mass, and the awful odor has vanished. Inside the remnants of the creature’s body, all you can find is a set of bones – the skeletal structure of a canine.
