# Extracurricular Activity

## Agenda 1: Quiet Halls

### A: Quiet Halls
You have arrived at the Miskatonic University campus in search of Professor Warren Rice. Classes are over, and a mysterious silence hangs in the air over the quad.

### B: Something Stirs
The university is dead silent. The shadows coil about your feet as you walk, and you swear there is something following you with each step you take. Is it just your imagination? Or is there really someone—or something—stalking you?

## Agenda 2: Dead of Night

### A: Dead of Night
Professor Rice’s disappearance isn’t the only thing amiss at the university. You’re unsure exactly what is going on, but you’re starting to believe Armitage was right in asking for your help.

### B: An Experiment Gone Wrong
A cry of fear echoes through the campus, and several students flee from the eastern side of the university, where the Science building can be found. Could this commotion be linked to Professor Rice’s disappearance?

## Agenda 3: The Beast Unleashed

### A: The Beast Unleashed
Some kind of wild creature is on the loose. Whatever it is, it appears to be headed toward the university dormitories.

### B: Not Fast Enough
Before you are able to act, you hear screaming from the northern side of the campus. You begin to make your way toward the screaming, your vision darkening with each step. As soon as the creature enters sight, you feel the darkness overtake you, and a force pulls you out of your consciousness. Everything goes black, and you pass out.
