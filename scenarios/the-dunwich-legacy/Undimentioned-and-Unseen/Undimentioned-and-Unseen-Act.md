# Undimentioned and Unseen

## Act 1: Saracenic Script

### A: Saracenic Script

The monsters tearing through Dunwich county are immune to traditional weapons. Only by reciting a particular incantation can the creatures be defeated. First you must search the ruins of Wilbur Whateley’s home in order to find the final sections of the otherworldly script.

### B: Obtaining the Formula

* If Dr. Armitage survived The Dunwich Legacy:

“There!” Armitage sighs a breath of relief, jotting down the last phrases of the formula. “I have translated the last of it.” He shudders as he hands you the script, the words conjuring forth memories of his battle with the creature. “I hope this is the last time I’ll have to read it,” he admits. “But if we do nothing, the end result will be much, much worse.”
Each investigator puts into play 1 set-aside Esoteric Formula.

* If Dr. Armitage is listed under “Sacrificed to Yog-Sothoth”:

Using the information contained within the ruins of the Whateley homestead, you are able to transcribe the remainder of the formula previously used by Dr. Armitage to destroy the beast that plagued Dunwich. However, the endeavor sets you back several hours.
Each investigator puts into play 1 set-aside Esoteric Formula. Place 1 doom on the current agenda.

## Act 2: They Must Be Destroyed!

### A: They Must Be Destroyed!

With the formula in hand, you finally have the means to destroy the creatures wreaking havoc in Dunwich... but only if you can survive long enough.

### B: The Brood is Ended

As you complete the incantation, the foul creature cries out with a raucous, inhuman voice. It rumbles and cracks, the syllables of its croaking far from English. As its cry plays out, the creature shrinks upon itself, and then, with little warning, it is gone. All that remains is a foul stench and a repulsive mark that mars the vegetation where the beast once stood.
