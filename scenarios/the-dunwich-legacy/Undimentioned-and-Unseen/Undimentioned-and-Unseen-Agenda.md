# Undimentioned and Unseen

## Agenda 1: Rampaging Creatures

### A: Rampaging Creatures

Reports of terrifying entities wreaking havoc across the countryside have caused the citizens of Dunwich to panic. Worse, the creatures seem to be invisible to the naked eye.

### B: Calamity Strikes

An old pickup truck rolls to a stop along the weathered trails of Dunwich. The driver—Joe Osborn—calls out to you through a shattered driver-side window, the truck’s engine still running. “It’s over at the Ericks’ farm!” he shouts. “Done blasted their place apart. Poor Henry and Martha...”
You ask Osborn for the location of the Ericks’ homestead, and it confirms your worst fear. For that attack to have occurred recently, there must be more of the monsters on the loose.

* Shuffle the encounter discard pile into the encounter deck.
* Spawn 1 of the set-aside Brood of Yog-Sothoth enemies at a random location, if able.

## Agenda 2: Biding Its Time

### A: Biding Its Time

Once in a while a wind, sweeping up out of Cold Spring Glen, would bring a touch of ineffable foetor to the heavy night air... But the looked-for terror did not appear. Whatever was down there in the glen was biding its time, and Armitage told his colleagues it would be suicidal to try to attack it in the dark.

—H. P. Lovecraft, “The Dunwich Horror”

### B: No Place to Hide

* Shuffle the encounter discard pile into the encounter deck.
* If there is a set-aside Brood of Yog-Sothoth, the lead investigator reads the following (out loud):

Bleak storm clouds churn overhead and a blanket of rain pelts the countryside. As the downpour grows in intensity, you take refuge in a half-ruined shack nearby. There is a flash of lightning, and in the brief illumination, you spot the outline of something large in the rain. Without warning, the distant trees bend, though nothing seems to be bending them. Moments later, a force with the strength of a truck crashes into your refuge.

* Spawn 1 of the set-aside Brood of Yog-Sothoth enemies at the lead investigator’s location, if able. Then, each investigator at that location tests [Agility] (4). The newly spawned Brood of Yog-Sothoth makes an attack against each investigator who fails this skill test.

## Agenda 3: Horrors Unleashed

### A: Horrors Unleashed

It was no joke tracking down something as big as a house that one could not see, but that had all the vicious malevolence of a daemon.
—H. P. Lovecraft, “The Dunwich Horror”

### B: Into the Hills

There is a monstrous rumbling throughout the countryside, though it is impossible to tell whether its source is the creatures you hunt or the very mountains themselves. Soon after, you find more of the creatures’ tracks leading up toward the hills: a thirty-foot path of crushed underbrush and trees snapped like twigs. Exhausted from battle, and with night fast approaching, you decide to head to safety rather than follow these hellish tracks.
