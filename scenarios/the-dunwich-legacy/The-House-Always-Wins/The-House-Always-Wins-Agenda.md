# The House Always Wins

## Agenda 1: The Clover Club

### A: The Clover Club
You have entered the Clover Club Casino in search of Dr. Morgan. The club is bustling at this late hour, filled with patrons looking to relax and drink, or make it big. You don’t appear to be in much danger.

### B: On the Right Track
Your questioning has drawn the attention of several men – hired thugs, by the look of them. “Francis doesn’t want to be bothered,” one of them says. “We suggest you leave the premises before we force you to leave.”

## Agenda 2: Underground Muscle

### A: Underground Muscle
Most of the other patrons seem oblivious to the mobsters and goons closing in around you. But you recognize this for what it really is – you’re about to get roughed up.

### B: Sudden Chaos
You hear a crash from somewhere outside and screams of pain in the lounge. A terrible monstrosity smashes through the entrance to the club, crushing the stairwell and knocking over gangsters and patrons alike.

## Agenda 3: Chaos in the Clover Club

### A: Chaos in the Clover Club
Amidst the chaos and confusion, the strange abominations attack everyone in the club. Screams echo through the halls as the blood begins to spray.

### B: The Building collapses
As the strange abominations continue to rampage through the club, the building’s foundations shake and tremble. You flee toward the exit, but you are caught in the collapsing rubble as the club is destroyed.
