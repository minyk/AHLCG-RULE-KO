# The House Always Wins

## Act 1: Beginner’s Luck

### A: Beginner’s Luck
You need to find Dr. Morgan. The club is packed; perhaps somebody knows where he is.

### B: High Roller
After speaking to a number of gamblers and servers, it seems as though Dr. Morgan has had quite the run lately. Instead of cashing out his winnings, he was convinced to double down. He was last seen entering the guarded hall near the back of the cardroom.

## Act 2: Skin Game

### A: Skin Game
Dr. Morgan is somewhere in the private section of the club, where only VIPs and the club’s managers are allowed. If you are to find him, you’re going to have to sneak or even fight your way in.

### B: Dr. Morgan's Fate
If the players have not yet completed Extracurricular Activity:
You find Dr. Morgan gambling in one of the VIP rooms...but he appears to be playing cards with two unconscious bodies, his pupils dilated as though in a trance. He can’t seem to stop laughing, smiling, and chatting with the other “players.”

If the players have completed Extracurricular Activity:
The VIP rooms are filled with the mangled and bloody bodies of unfortunate patrons. There doesn’t appear to be any trace of Dr. Morgan. You hear screaming and gunfire from the main area of the club.


## Act 3: All In

### A: All In
With or without Dr. Morgan, you have to get out of here. Fast.

### B: Safe... For Now
You escape the club, doing your best to look inconspicuous as several cars pull up near the street. A handful of grim-faced men and women exit, running toward the restaurant’s entrance to take control of the situation. One of them catches your eye, his hand on the grip of his .38, but thankfully he turns his attention back to the rest of his crew and follows them into the club. You breathe a sigh of relief...

## Act 3: Fold

### A: Fold
“Free drinks for whoever gets me the hell out of here!” A man exclaims from the bar.

### B: Escaping the Club
You make your way toward the rain-slicked streets of Arkham.
