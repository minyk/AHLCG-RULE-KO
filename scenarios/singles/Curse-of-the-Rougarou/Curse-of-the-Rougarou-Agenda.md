### Agenda 1: A Creature of the Bayou

#### A

After arriving in New Orleans the next day, you start your investigation by asking the locals what they knew of the recent killings. As you suspected, most know very little of the incidents. You do manage to find several eyewitnesses who give similar descriptions of the creature: its lithe, muscular form, lanky arms, and wolf-like visage. A promising start - but if there is any truth to the rumors about this "curse", you'll have to talk to Lady Esprit herself.

#### B

A violent storm rolls in as your search continues. Black rainclouds conquer the sky, the air thick with humidity. You recall that all of the recent killings took place late at night, under the cover of dark clouds. A shiver runs down your spine - what if you are next?

### Agenda 2: The Rougarou Feeds

#### A

Around you, the bayou feasts. Flesh rips and jaws snap just beyond the trees, and light droplets of rain ripple upon the surface of the water. You can't tell exactly where the sounds are coming from. Perhaps it's the dreadful ambience of the bayou itself.

#### B

A clash of thunder roars through the sky, and you reel in pain from the sudden explosion of noise. Your vision doubles, and bile leaps up your throat. A lone howl returns the call of the sky, echoing throughout the bayou. You wrench yourself off the muddy ground and find your bearings, unable to shake the feeling that you're running out of time.

### Agenda 3: The Curse Spreads

#### A

Tendrils of slime ooze from the bogs, crawling over tree roots and grasping at you as you pass. The air hangs heavy with a noxious heat. You feel as though you are sinking, sinking deep into the bayou, sinking beneath the heaviness of the black sky and the rank mist...

#### B

A high-pitched shriek echoes through the bayou, followed by the sinister howls of the accursed Rougarou. The beast has drawn blood again - this you are sure of.

* The bearer of the Curse of the Rougarou weakness read the following (out loud):

You feel something dripping from your hand, and are surprised to find your knuckles bloody and torn. Nearby, the bard of a tree is smashed and dripping with blood. The anger of your failure slowly fades as you realize the blood is yours.
