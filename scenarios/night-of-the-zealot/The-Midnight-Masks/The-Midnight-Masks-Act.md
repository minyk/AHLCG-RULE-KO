## The Midnight Masks

### Act 1: Uncovering the Conspiracy

#### A

You have one night to find the members of this cult and unveil their plan. The more members of the cult you can find and interrogate before midnight, the better.

#### B

You’ve successfully uncovered the identities of all of the cult’s high-ranking members within Arkham. The man who had stalked you throughout the city was dedicated in his conviction, as was Herman, the undertaker of the graveyard. Others seemed to have been coerced to aid the cult. Ruth, the mortician, had been told that her family would be killed if she did not supply the ghouls with fresh corpses. Thankfully, you managed to help her escape the hospital safely. Peter, the professor, had to be convinced that his involvement with the cult would do more harm than good. Victoria’s obsession with occult artifacts had landed her deep within the cult’s web. When you confronted Drew in the asylum, he attacked you—but interestingly, he did so because he thought you were part of the cult. The deeper you delve into this conspiracy, the clearer it becomes that many lives have been ruined by it.
