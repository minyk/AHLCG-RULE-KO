# Cardtypes
 e game’s cardtypes are presented in Appendix IV, with detailed card anatomies (see “Appendix IV: Card Anatomy” on page 28).
= If an ability causes a card to change its cardtype, it loses all other cardtypes it might possess and functions as would any card of the new cardtype.
See also: “Asset Cards” on page 4, “Enemy Cards” on page 10, “Event Cards” on page 11, “Location Cards” on page 14, “Skill Cards” on page 18, “Treachery Cards” on page 20.

## Player Cardtypes

### Asset Cards
Asset cards represent items, allies, talents, spells, and other reserves that may assist or be used by an investigator during a scenario.
= When you play an asset, it is placed in your play area. Generally, assets remain in play unless discarded by a card ability or game step.
= Some assets have health and/or sanity. When an investigator is dealt damage or horror, that investigator may assign some or all of that damage or horror to eligible asset cards he or she controls (see “Dealing Damage/Horror” on page 7).
= Most assets take up one or more slots while in play (see “Slots” on page 19).
= Some assets have an encounter set icon and no level indicator. Such assets are known as Story Assets. Story Assets are part of an encounter set and may not be included in a player’s deck unless the resolution or setup of a scenario grants that player permission to do so.

### Event Cards
Event cards represent tactical actions, maneuvers, spells, tricks, and other instantaneous e ects at a player’s disposal.
= If an event card does not have the fast keyword, it may only be played from a player’s hand by performing a “Play” action during his or her turn. You must follow all play permissions/restrictions that card has.
= A fast event card may be played from a player’s hand any time its play instructions specify (see “Fast” on page 11).
= Any time a player plays an event card, its costs are paid, its e ects are resolved (or canceled), and the card is placed in its owner’s discard pile a er those e ects resolve (or are canceled).
= If the e ects of an event card are canceled, the card is still considered to have been played, and its costs remain paid. Only the e ects have been canceled.
= Playing an event card from hand (or not playing it) is always optional for a player, unless the event uses the word “must” in its play instructions.
= An event card cannot be played unless the resolution of its e ect has the potential to change the game state.

### Skill Cards
Skill cards represent innate or learned a ributes or character traits that improve an investigator’s skill tests.
Skill cards are not played from a player’s hand. In order to resolve their abilities, skill cards must be commi ed to a skill test.
If a skill card is commi ed to a skill test, its ability may be used during the resolution of that skill test, as speci ed on the card.
See “Skill Test Timing” on page 26.

## Encounter cardtypes

### Enemy Cards
Enemies represent villains, cultists, ne’er-do-wells, terrible monsters, and unfathomable entities from alternate dimensions or the cosmos beyond.
When an enemy card is drawn by an investigator, that investigator must spawn it following any spawn direction the card bears (see “Spawn” on page 19). If the encountered enemy has no spawn direction, the enemy spawns engaged with the investigator encountering the card and is placed in that investigator’s threat area.
See “1.4 Each investigator draws 1 encounter card” on page 24.
= A ready, unengaged enemy engages any time it is at the same location as an investigator (see “Enemy Engagement” on page 10).
= If an investigator is engaged with a ready enemy and takes an action other than to  ght, to evade, or to activate a parley or resign ability, that enemy makes an a ack of opportunity (see “A ack of Opportunity” on page 5).
= Enemies with the hunter keyword move during the Enemy Phase (see “III. Enemy phase” on page 25).
= Engaged enemies a ack during the Enemy Phase (see “III. Enemy phase” on page 25).

### Treachery Cards
Treachery cards represent curses, a ictions, madnesses, obstacles, disasters, or other unexpected occurrences an investigator may encounter throughout the course of a scenario.
When a treachery card is drawn by an investigator, that investigator must resolve its e ects.  en, place the card in its discard pile unless otherwise instructed by the ability.
See “1.4 Each investigator draws 1 encounter card” on page 24.
