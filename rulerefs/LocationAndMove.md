# Location Cards
Location cards represent the places the investigators may explore during a scenario.
= Use each investigator’s mini-card to indicate which location he or she is at.
= While an investigator is at a location, that investigator, each of his or her assets, and each card in that investigator’s threat area is at the same location.
= Locations enter play in an “unrevealed” state, so that the side with no shroud value and/or clue value is faceup. Do not read the “revealed” side at this time.
=  e  rst time a location is entered by an investigator, that location is revealed by turning it to its other side and placing a number of clues on it equal to its clue value (this may occur during setup). Most clue values are conveyed as a “per investigator” ( ) value.
= A location with its shroud/clue value side faceup is in the “revealed” state.

# Move
Any time an entity (an investigator or enemy) moves, transfer that enemy card or investigator’s mini card from its current location to a di erent location.
= Unless otherwise speci ed by the move e ect or ability, the moving entity must move to a connecting location. Connecting locations are identi ed on the location card representing the entity’s current location, as shown below.
= Any time an entity moves, it is considered to leave the previous location, and to enter the new location, simultaneously.
= If an entity is “moved to...” a speci c location, the entity is moved directly to that location, and does not pass through other locations en route.
= If an investigator moves to an unrevealed location, that location is revealed by turning it to its other side, and placing a number of clues on it equal to its clue value. Most clue values are conveyed as a “per investigator” ( ) value.
= If an enemy moves to an unrevealed location, that location remains unrevealed.
= Game elements (tokens or cards) may also be moved by card abilities from one card to another, or from one game area to another game area.
= When an entity or game element moves, it cannot move to its same (current) placement. If there is no valid destination for a move, the move cannot be a empted.
