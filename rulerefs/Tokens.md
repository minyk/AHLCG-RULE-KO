Tokens, Running out of
 ere is no limit to the number of tokens (of any type) which can be in the game area at a given time. If players run out of the provided tokens, other tokens, counters, or coins may be used to track the current game state.

Chaos Tokens
Chaos tokens are revealed from the chaos bag during skill tests, to modify or in uence the results of the skill test.
       —If any of these tokens are revealed for a skill test, resolve the e ect for that symbol as indicated on the scenario reference card for the current scenario.
 — is is the auto-fail token. If this token is revealed for a skill test, it indicates the investigator automatically fails the test (see “Automatic Failure/Success” on page 5).
 — is is the elder sign token. If this token is revealed for a skill test, resolve the   e ect on the investigator card belonging to the player performing the skill test.
If a revealed chaos token (or the e ect referenced by a chaos token) has a numerical modi er, that modi er is applied to the investigator’s skill value for this test.
See “ST.3 Reveal chaos token” on page 26.

Clues
Clues represent the progress the investigators can make towards solving a mystery, unraveling a conspiracy, and/or advancing in a scenario.
=  e  rst time an investigator enters a location, that location is revealed (turned face-up) and a number of clues equal to that location’s clue value are placed on that location (from the token pool). Most clue values are conveyed as a “per investigator ( )” value.  is may occur during setup.
= A clue at a location can be discovered by successfully investigating the location (see “Investigate Action” on page 13), or by a card ability. If an investigator discovers a
clue, he or she takes the clue from the location and places
it on his or her investigator card, under his or her control.
= If there are no “Objective – ” requirements for advancing the current act, during any investigator’s turn the investigators may, as a group, spend the requisite number of clues (usually conveyed as a “per investigator” value) from their investigator cards to advance the act deck.  is is normally done as a   player ability. Any or all investigators may contribute any number of clues towards the total number of clues required to advance the act.
= A card ability that refers to clues “at a location” is referring to the undiscovered clues that are currently on that location.

Doom
Doom represents the progress the forces of the Mythos make towards completing foul rituals, summoning cosmic entities, and/or advancing a scenario’s agenda.
= During each Mythos phase, 1 doom is placed on the current agenda (see “I. Mythos phase” on page 24).
= If there are no “Objective – ” requirements for advancing the current agenda and the requisite amount of doom is in play (among the agenda and all cards in play), the agenda advances during the “Check doom threshold” step of the Mythos phase. Unless a card otherwise speci es that it can advance the agenda, this is the only time at which the agenda can advance.
= Doom on cards other than the agenda (such as enemies, allies, locations, etc.) counts towards the amount of doom in play.

Resources
Resources represent the various means of acquiring new cards at an investigator’s disposal – supplies, money, tools, knowledge, spell components, etc.
= In order to play a card or use an ability that costs resources, an investigator must pay that card or ability’s resource cost by taking the speci ed number of resources from his or her resource pool and returning them to the token pool (see “Costs” on page 7).
= Resources can be gained by performing the “Resource” action (see “Resource Action” on page 17).
= Investigators acquire one resource during each Upkeep phase (see “4.4 Each investigator draws 1 card and gains 1 resource” on page 25).
