# Enemy Engagement
While an enemy card is in play, it is either engaged with an investigator (and placed in that investigator’s threat area), or it is unengaged and at a location (and placed at that location). Each enemy in an investigator’s threat area is considered to be at the same location as that investigator, and should the investigator move, the enemy remains engaged and moves
to the new location simultaneously with the investigator.
Any time a ready unengaged enemy is at the same location
as an investigator, it engages that investigator, and is placed
in that investigator’s threat area. If there are multiple investigators at the same location as a ready unengaged enemy, follow the enemy’s prey instructions to determine which investigator is engaged.  ere is no limit on the number of enemies that can be engaged with a single investigator.
For example, a ready unengaged enemy immediately engages if: = It spawns at the same location as an investigator,
= It moves into the same location as an investigator,
= An investigator moves into the same location as it.
An exhausted unengaged enemy does not engage, but if an exhausted enemy at the same location as an investigator becomes ready, it engages as soon as it is readied.
= Note: An enemy with the Aloof keyword does not engage in the manner described above.
