# Winning and Losing

Each scenario has a number of di erent possible endings.

The act deck represents the progress of the investigators through a scenario. Some instructions in the act deck (as well as on other encounter cardtypes) contain resolution points, in the format of: “(→R#).”  e players’ primary objective is to advance through the act deck until a (hopefully favorable) resolution point is reached. Should the act deck invoke a resolution, the players have completed the scenario (they may even have “won!”). Instructions for resolving the designated resolution are found in the “do not read until end of game” section of the campaign manual.

The agenda deck represents the objectives and progress of the malicious forces pi ed against the investigators in the scenario. Some instructions in the agenda deck (as well as on other encounter cardtypes) also contain resolution points, in the format of: “(→R#).” Should the agenda deck invoke a (usually darker) resolution, the players have lost the scenario. Instructions for resolving the designated resolution are found in the “do not read until end of game” section of the campaign guide.

Should the scenario end with no resolution being reached (for example, if all investigators have been eliminated or have resigned), instructions for resolving the scenario can be found in the “do not read until end of game” section of the campaign guide.
= If playing in a campaign, players will proceed to the next scenario in the campaign regardless of the outcome of the scenario. Even if players “lose” a scenario, they still continue their campaign (although with some negative consequences from their failure).
= When playing a standalone scenario, players either win or lose the scenario.  ey win if they complete a resolution on an act card. Any other resolution is considered a loss (see “Standalone Mode” on page 19).
