## Skill Tests
A number of situations in the game require an investigator to make a skill test, using one of his or her four skills: willpower ( ), intellect ( ), combat ( ), or agility ( ). A skill test pits
the investigator’s value in a speci ed skill against a di culty value that is determined by the ability or game step that
initiated the test.  e investigator is a empting to match or exceed this di culty value in order to succeed at the test.

A  skill test is o en referred to as a test of the speci ed skill. (For example: “agility test,” “combat test,” “willpower test,” or “intellect test.”)

## Modifiers
Some abilities cause values or quantities of characteristics to be modi ed.  e game state constantly checks and (if necessary) updates the count of any variable value or quantity that is being modified.
Any time a new modi er is applied (or removed), the entire quantity is recalculated from the start, considering the unmodified base value and all active modifiers.
= When calculating a value, treat all modifiers as being applied simultaneously. However, while performing the calculation, all additive and subtractive modifiers are calculated before doubling and/or halving modifiers.
= Fractional values are rounded up a er all modifiers have been applied.
= A quantity on a card (such as a stat, an icon, a number of instances of a trait or keyword) cannot be reduced so that it functions with a value below zero. Negative modifiers in excess of a value’s current quantity can be applied, but, after all active modifiers have been applied, any resultant value below zero is treated as zero. (For example: Danny tests agility and reveals a –8 chaos token. When applied to his agility of 4, this would reduce his skill value to –4. However, his agility cannot be reduced so that it functions with a value below zero. While the –8 modi er still exists, his agility is treated as zero. If Danny were to play “Lucky!” to receive a +2 bonus to the test, this bonus would not be applied to the functioning skill value of zero; but rather, it is applied in conjunction with all active modifiers. Danny’s agility would then be calculated as follows: base skill 4, –8 from chaos token, +2 from “Lucky!” for a total of –2, which is still treated as zero.)

## Skill Test Timing

ST.1 Determine skill type of test. Skill test of that type begins.
This step formalizes the beginning of a skill test.  ere are four types of skill tests: willpower tests, intellect tests, combat tests, and agility tests.  e card ability or game rule determines which type of test is necessary, and thereby a test of that type begins.

ST.2 Commit cards from hand to skill test.
The investigator performing the skill test may commit any number of cards with an appropriate skill icon from his or her hand to this test.
Each other investigator at the same location as the investigator performing the skill test may commit one card with an appropriate skill icon to this test.
An appropriate skill icon is either one that matches the skill being tested, or a wild icon.  e investigator performing this test gets +1 to his or her skill value during this test for each appropriate skill icon that is commi ed to this test.
Cards that lack an appropriate skill icon may not be commi ed to a skill test. Do not pay a card’s resource cost when commi ing it.

ST.3 Reveal chaos token.
The investigator performing the skill test reveals one chaos token at random from the chaos bag.

ST.4 Apply chaos symbol e ect(s).
Apply any e ects initiated by the symbol on the revealed chaos token. Each of the following symbols indicates that an ability on the scenario reference card must initiate:  ,  ,  , or  .

The   symbol indicates that the   ability on the investigator card belonging to the player performing the test must initiate.

If none of the above symbols are revealed, or if the icon has no corresponding ability, this step completes with no e ect.

ST.5 Determine investigator’s modi ed skill value.
Start with the base skill (of the skill that matches the type of test that is resolving) of the investigator performing this test, and apply all active modi ers, including the appropriate icons that have been commi ed to this test, e ects of the chaos token(s) revealed, and all active card abilities that are modifying the investigator’s skill value.

ST.6 Determine success/failure of skill test.
Compare the investigator’s modi ed skill value to the di culty of the skill test.

If the investigator’s skill value equals or exceeds the di culty for this test (as indicated by the card or game mechanic invoking the test), the investigator succeeds at the test.
* If an investigator automatically succeeds at a test via a card ability, the total di culty of that test is considered 0.

If the investigator’s skill value is less than the di culty for this test, the investigator fails at the test.
* If an investigator automatically fails at a test via a card ability or revealing the   symbol, his or her total skill value for that test is considered 0.

ST.7 Apply skill test results.
The card ability or game rule that initiated a skill test usually indicates the consequences of success and/or failure for that test. (Additionally, some other card abilities may contribute additional consequences, or modify existing consequences, at this time.) Resolve the appropriate consequences (based on the success or failure established during step ST.6) at this time.
If there are multiple results to be applied during this step, the investigator performing the test applies those results in the order of his or her choice.

ST.8 Skill test ends.
This step formalizes the end of this skill test. Discard all cards that were commi ed to this skill test, and return all revealed chaos tokens to the chaos bag.
