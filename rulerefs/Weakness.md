# Weakness

Weakness is a card sub-type.  ese cards represent character  aws, curses, madnesses, injuries, tasks, enemies, or story elements that are part of an investigator’s backstory, or that are acquired over the course of a campaign. Weakness cards are resolved di erently depending upon their cardtype.
= When an investigator draws a weakness with an encounter cardtype (for example, an enemy or a treachery weakness), resolve that card as if it were just drawn from the encounter deck.
= When an investigator draws a weakness with a player cardtype (for example, an asset, an event, or a skill weakness), resolve any Revelation e ects on the card, and add it to that investigator’s hand.  e card may then be used as any other player card of its type.
= If a weakness enters an investigator’s hand in a manner that did not involve drawing the card, that investigator must resolve the card (including any Revelation abilities) as if he or she had just drawn it.
=  e bearer of a weakness is the investigator who started the game with the weakness in his or her deck or play area.
= If a weakness is added to a player’s deck or hand during the play of a scenario, that weakness remains a part of that investigator’s deck for the rest of the campaign. (Unless it is removed from the campaign by a card ability or scenario resolution.)
= A player may not optionally choose to discard a weakness card from hand, unless a card explicitly speci es otherwise.
= Weaknesses with an encounter cardtype are, like other encounter cards, not controlled by any player. Weaknesses with a player cardtype are controlled by their bearer.
= Some card and game text references a “basic weakness." A basic weakness can be identi ed by the presence of the words “Basic Weakness” and the symbol indicated below
