## Health and Damage
Health represents a card’s physical fortitude. Damage tracks the physical harm that has been done to a card during a scenario.
= Any time a card takes damage, place a number of damage tokens equal to the amount of damage just taken on the card (see “Dealing Damage/Horror” on page 7).
= If an investigator has damage on him or her equal to or greater than his or her health, that investigator is defeated. When an investigator is defeated, he or she is eliminated from the scenario (see “Elimination” on page 10).
= In campaign play, an investigator that is defeated by taking damage equal to his or her health su ers 1 physical trauma. Taking physical trauma may cause an investigator to be killed (see “Campaign Play” on page 5 for more information).
= If an enemy has damage on it equal to or greater than its health, that enemy is defeated and placed in the encounter discard pile.
= If an asset with a health value has damage on it equal to or greater than its health, it is defeated and placed on its owner’s discard pile.
= An asset card without a health value is not considered to have a health of 0, cannot gain health, and cannot have damage assigned to it.
= A card’s “remaining health” is its base health minus the amount of damage on it, plus or minus any active health modi ers.

## Sanity and Horror
Sanity represents a card’s mental and emotional fortitude. Horror tracks the harm that has been done to a card’s psyche by exposure to the Mythos.
= When a card takes horror, place a number of horror tokens equal to the amount of horror just taken on the card (see “Dealing Damage/Horror” on page 7).
= If an investigator has horror on him or her equal to or greater than his or her sanity, that investigator is defeated. When an investigator is defeated, he or she is eliminated from the scenario (see “Elimination” on page 10).
= In campaign play, an investigator that is defeated by taking horror equal to his or her sanity su ers 1 mental trauma. Taking mental trauma may cause an investigator to be driven insane (see “Campaign Play” on page 5 for more information).
= If an asset with a sanity value has horror on it equal to or greater than its sanity, it is defeated and placed on its owner’s discard pile.
= A card’s “remaining sanity” is its base sanity minus the amount of horror on that card, plus or minus any active sanity modi ers.
= An asset card without a sanity value is not considered to have a sanity of 0, cannot gain sanity, and cannot have horror assigned to it.
