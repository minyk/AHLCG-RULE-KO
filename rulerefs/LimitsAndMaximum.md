# Limits and Maximum

“Limit X per [period]” is a limit that appears on cards that remain in play through the resolution of an ability’s e ect. Each instance of an ability with such a limit may be initiated X times during the designated period. If a card leaves play and re-enters play during the same period, the card is considered to be bringing a new instance of the ability to the game.
“Limit X per [card/game element]” is a limit that appears on a achment cards, and restricts the number of copies of that card (by title) that can be a ached
to each designated card or game element.
= Unless stated otherwise, limits are player speci c.
= A “group limit,” however, applies to the entire group of investigators. (For example, if an investigator triggers an ability that is “group limit once per game,” no other investigator may trigger that ability during that game.)
“Max X per [period]” imposes a maximum across all copies of a card (by title) for all players. Generally, this phrase imposes a maximum number of times that copies of that
card can be played during the designated time period. If a maximum includes the word “commi ed” (For example, “Max 1 commi ed per skill test”), it imposes a maximum number of copies of that card that can be commi ed to skill tests during the designated period. If a maximum appears as part of an ability, it imposes a maximum number of times that ability can be initiated from all copies (by title) of cards bearing that ability (including itself), during the designated period.
If the e ects of a card or ability with a limit or maximum are canceled, it is still counted against the limit/ maximum, because the ability has been initiated.
