# Actions

During his or her turn, an investigator is permi ed to take up to three actions. When performing an action, all costs of the action are  rst paid.  en, the consequences of the action resolve.
= If an investigator is instructed to lose 1 or more actions, he or she has that many fewer actions to take during that round.

## Draw Action
“Draw” is an action an investigator may take during his or her turn in the investigation phase.
When an investigator takes this action, that investigator draws one card from his or her deck.

## Engage Action
“Engage” is an action an investigator may take during his or her turn in the investigation phase.
To engage an enemy at the same location (for example, this could be done to engage an exhausted enemy, an aloof enemy, or an enemy engaged with another investigator), an investigator places the chosen enemy in his or her threat area.  e investigator and the enemy are now engaged.
= An investigator may perform the engage action to engage an enemy that is engaged with a di erent investigator
at the same location.  e enemy simultaneously disengages from the previous investigator and
engages the investigator performing the action.
= An investigator cannot use the engage action to engage an enemy he or she is already engaged with.

## Evade, Evade Action
“Evade” is an action an investigator may take during his or her turn in the investigation phase.
To evade an enemy engaged with an investigator, that investigator makes an agility test against the enemy’s evade value (see “Skill Tests” on page 18).
If the test is successful, the investigator successfully evades the enemy (see below). ( is occurs during step 7 of the skill test, per “ST.7 Apply skill test results” on page 26.)
If the test fails, the investigator does not evade the enemy, and it remains engaged with him or her.
= If an ability “automatically” evades 1 or more enemies, no skill test is made for the evasion a empt.
= Any time an enemy is evaded (whether by an evade action, or by card ability), the enemy is exhausted (if it was ready) and the engagement is broken. Move the enemy from the investigator’s threat area to the investigator’s location to mark that it is no longer engaged with that investigator.
= Unlike the  ght and engage action, an investigator can only perform an evade action against
an enemy engaged with him or her.

## Fight Action
“Fight” is an action an investigator may take during his or her turn in the investigation phase.
To  ght an enemy at his or her location, an investigator resolves an a ack against that enemy by making a combat test against the enemy’s  ght value (see “Skill Tests” on page 18).
If the test is successful, the a ack succeeds and damage is dealt to the a acked enemy.  e default damage dealt by an a ack is 1. Some weapons, spells, or other special a acks may modify this damage. ( is occurs during step 7 of the skill test, per “ST.7 Apply skill test results” on page 26.)
If the test fails, no damage is dealt to the a acked enemy. However, if an investigator fails this test against an enemy that is engaged with another single investigator, the damage of the a ack is dealt to the investigator engaged with that enemy.
= An investigator may  ght any enemy at his or her location, including: an enemy he or she is engaged with, an unengaged enemy at the same location, or an enemy engaged with another investigator who is at the same location.

## Investigate Action
“Investigate” is an action an investigator may take during his or her turn in the investigation phase.
Each time an investigator takes this action, he or she makes an intellect test against the shroud value of that location (see “Skill Tests” on page 18).
If the test is successful, the investigator has succeeded in investigating the location, he or she discovers one clue at the location. ( is occurs during step 7 of the skill test, per “ST.7 Apply skill test results” on page 26.)
Any time an investigator discovers a clue from a location, that player takes the clue from the location and places it on his or her investigator card, under his or her control.
If the test is failed, the investigator has failed in investigating the location. No clues are discovered during step 7 of the skill test.

## Move Action
“Move” is an action an investigator may take during his or her turn in the investigation phase.
When an investigator takes this action, move that investigator (using his or her mini card) to any other location that is marked as a connecting location on his or her current location (see “Move” on page 15).

### Move
Any time an entity (an investigator or enemy) moves, transfer that enemy card or investigator’s mini card from its current location to a di erent location.
= Unless otherwise speci ed by the move e ect or ability, the moving entity must move to a connecting location. Connecting locations are identi ed on the location card representing the entity’s current location, as shown below.
= Any time an entity moves, it is considered to leave the previous location, and to enter the new location, simultaneously.
= If an entity is “moved to...” a speci c location, the entity is moved directly to that location, and does not pass through other locations en route.
= If an investigator moves to an unrevealed location, that location is revealed by turning it to its other side, and placing a number of clues on it equal to its clue value. Most clue values are conveyed as a “per investigator” ( ) value.
= If an enemy moves to an unrevealed location, that location remains unrevealed.
= Game elements (tokens or cards) may also be moved by card abilities from one card to another, or from one game area to another game area.
= When an entity or game element moves, it cannot move to its same (current) placement. If there is no valid destination for a move, the move cannot be a empted.

## Play Action
“Play” is an action an investigator may take during his or her turn in the investigation phase.
When an investigator takes this action, that investigator selects an asset or event card in his or her hand, pays its resource cost, and plays it (see “Play” on page 16).
=  Cards with the “fast” keyword are not played by using this action (see “Fast” on page 11).
= Skill cards are not “played.”  ese cards are commi ed to a skill test from a player’s hand in order to use their abilities.

## Resource Action
“Resource” is an action an investigator may take during his or her turn in the investigation phase.
When an investigator takes this action, that investigator gains one resource by taking it from the token pool and adding it to his or her resource pool.
